   - Mainly show documents as per name given
   - With categories is the filter option as we also have to define some of the categories in advance which every person have like (Degree, diploma, high school, give at least this all three must for educations and we are giving this categories separately, other options like medical, home related or properties, and other many more options.)

     2.1. **Group documents when uploading** (**Priority: 2.1**) -x This is required as some of these    documents have same type of documents which must stay in the group. - e.g., college results, fees receipts
