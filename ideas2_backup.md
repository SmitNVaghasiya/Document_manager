# Document Manager App Ideas (Page 2 & 3, Prioritized)

**Main Tasks: 10**
**Sub-Tasks: 13**

---

1. **Take picture directly, file storage option** (**Priority: 5**)

   - Give this as two options

2. **Download documents & open document options** (**Priority: 6**)

   - Single document
   - Whole group also possible
   - Open in my application or all the options available in system

3. **Share document to other applications** (**Priority: 7**)

4. **Password & lock screen (password & fingerprint) options** (**Priority: 8**)
    -- it is not neccessary to set the lock it is optional option if needed.

5. **Rename uploaded file** (**Priority: 9**)

6. **In whole group, give first numbers & show orders** (**Priority: 10**)

   - For the priority, not for the main page but to show the orders

7. **File manager must also store in groups option**

   - Store it in root folders
   - Helps when taking backup manually or moving folders to new system
   - Easy to configure all settings
   - Easy to take backup (**Priority: 12**)

8. **Docs to PDF without need to go elsewhere** (**Priority: 11**)

   - For images also
   - Include entire group to PDF (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
     - Merge PDFs together (**Priority: 11.2**)
     - Extract pages from it (**Priority: 11.3**)

9. **Compress the files if needed when sharing**

   - Give totally separate space where this would happen so not to affect the main look (**Priority: 14**)

10. **Lock & unlock option in each group or document** (**Priority: 13**)
    - So as not to affect file without clicking unlock, no pass needed
      - Any changes in file (like name, delete, or add file) must first unlock group without pass needed so as not to accidentally delete or change the file inside (**Priority: 13.1**)
